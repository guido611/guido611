</div>
<div class="section" id="obligations-of-licensor">
<h2>2. Obligations of Licensor<a class="headerlink" href="#obligations-of-licensor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>2.1 Licensor does not warrant that the availability of the Software will be uninterrupted or always error-free.</p>
<p>2.2 Licensor shall make the Software available to Licensee in an executable form (object code) for the Underlying Software. Licensor shall deliver the Software to Licensee by making it available for download on the Internet.</p>
<p>2.3 Licensee is not entitled to the source code of the Software.</p>
<p>2.4 Licensee may access the user manual available via https://github.com/tkrabel/edaviz. No other documentation shall be due unless explicitly agreed upon in writing.</p>
<p>2.5 Licensee shall install the Software.</p>
<p>2.6 Licensor is not obliged to provide any consulting, parameterization, customizing, migration, training, programming or other Licensee-specific project services (collectively referred to as “Services”) unless explicitly agreed upon by the Parties in writing.</p>
<p>2.7 In order to start and use the Software, Licensee must arrange for a sufficiently powerful Internet connection between Licensee’s IT-systems and Licensor’s server in order to verify the license of the Licensee. Depending on the type of license, Internet access for license verification may be necessary every 24 hours.</p>
<p>2.8 Licensor shall be entitled to use its own IT-systems and third-party systems and may freely subcontract obligations under this EULA.</p>
<p>2.9 Licensor shall be responsible for the availability of the server up to a suitable connection point to the Internet that Licensor shall determine (“<strong>Service Delivery Point</strong>”). The license provided by this EULA does not include further Internet connection of the access point of the Licensee.</p>
<p>2.10 Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the availability of the licensing server for 99% per calendar month (“<strong>Agreed Availability</strong>”). The licensing server shall be deemed available if accessible and correctly responding when contacted from the Service Delivery Point (“<strong>Availability</strong>”). Non-availability due to force majeure and other reasons outside of the responsibility of Licensor and Scheduled Downtimes (see sec. 2.12) are not taken into account for the calculation of the Availability if Scheduled Downtimes (1) are announced to Licensee by e-mail at least 24 hours prior to commencement (if Licensee has not waived such announcements) and (2) concern Saturdays or Sundays (at Licensor’s place of business), but for (3) a maximum of eight hours per calendar month. If in any given calendar month, the Availability falls short of the Agreed Availability for reasons imputable to Licensor, Licensor will, on Licensee’s request to be made within three months of the end of the respective calendar month, offer a discount on recurring fees, which, during the term of this Agreement, shall be offset against future recurring fees and only in the event of termination be payable in cash. Such discount shall be 1/720 of the monthly license fee per seat for every hour and licensed seat that could not be used to unavailability of the license server but in no case more than Licensee has actually paid for the licensed seat that could not be used for the respective month. The discount shall fully settle any reduction right under Sec. 536 of the German Civil Code. Claims in damages as referred to in Sec. 9 below as well as Licensor’s obligation to resolve the NonConformity under Sec. 7 shall remain unaffected. The foregoing shall not be deemed an express warranty, guarantee or guarantee of properties.</p>
<p>2.11 In order to carry out updates, configuration changes and certain maintenance work, it is necessary to take the licensing server out of operation for a specific period of time (“<strong>Scheduled Downtimes</strong>”). Scheduled Downtimes are communicated by Licensor via its website and communicated to Licensee via e-mail (unless Licensee has opted out from this information). Licensee is usually given notice of Scheduled Downtimes two weeks in advance. In urgent and exceptional cases, it may be necessary to arrange a Scheduled Downtime on shorter notice, e.g. in case of severe unexpected network traffic on the server like DoS/DDoS attacks or (attempted) unlawful intrusion of a third party on the server.</p>
<p>2.12 Licensor cannot guarantee the same feature set of the Software for all supported Underlying Software solutions and their versions based on the differences between the Underlying Software solutions itself. Therefore, the feature set of the software can differ between the underlying Software Solutions and their versions. A specific feature is only owed if Licensor has specified it as available for the respective combination of version of the Software and version of the Underlying Software.</p>
<p>2.13 Licensor strives to regularly – usually every month – publish new versions of the Software with new functionality (“<strong>Upgrades</strong>”), but shall not be obliged to do so.</p>
<p>2.14 Licensor will strive to provide the Licensee with an advance notice of any Update or Upgrade that may require changes to the Licensee’s hardware or software environment.</p>
<p>2.15 To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as provided otherwise in the EULA, Licensor is providing the Software “as is” without warranty of any kind including, without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, or any warranty or representation about the results from the use of the Software.</p>

<h2>3. Use of the Software and Licensee Obligations<a class="headerlink" href="#use-of-the-software-and-licensee-obligations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>3.1 Licensee is granted a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable right to use the Software for the term of this EULA with the number of users agreed upon. Licensor may from time to time conduct an audit to ensure that Licensee and its users are complying with the terms of this EULA.</p>
<p>3.2 Licensee is responsible for setting up his Jupyter environment by installing the correct versions of the respective Jupyter extensions listed in section 1.4. Licensor strives to assist Licensee with an initial setup of the system, but shall not be obliged to do so.</p>
<p>3.3 Licensor shall install the Software pursuant to this EULA only on Licensee’s network, i.e., only on computers that are owned by and in the possession of Licensee, except with the prior written approval by Licensor.</p>
<p>3.4 Licensee is entitled to allow freelancers and consultants that work on behalf of Licensee on or via its network to use the Software, provided, however, that such freelancers and consultants perform the work in accordance with the instructions issued by and for the purposes of Licensee.</p>
<p>3.5 Licensee shall protect the Software from unauthorized access of a third party. Licensee shall provide its employees and other users with a copy of this EULA and advice of them the restrictions on the use of the Software and the Licensee’s obligations under this EULA.</p>
<p>3.6 Licensee is entitled to make back-up copies of the Software required for a safe operation of the Software and shall store the back-up copies in a secure place. Licensee shall delete or destroy any copies that it no longer needs or at the end of the term of the EULA, whichever is sooner. Licensee shall not delete, modify or suppress copyright notices and marks.</p>
<p>3.7 Licensee may not rent, lend or distribute in any form, or use the Software by and on behalf of third parties (e.g., by outsourcing, hosting, Software as a Service), without the prior written consent of Licensor. Licensee shall not transfer the Software to a third party or allow a third party to use or gain knowledge of the Software. Licensee shall not grant third parties direct or remote access to the Software including the screen of the computer running the Software, or use the Software on behalf of a third party.</p>
<p>3.8 Licensor is the sole owner of all intellectual property rights to the Software, including copyright, but does not own the open source software identified in sec. 1.4.</p>
<p>3.9 Data backups are the sole responsibility of Licensee. Licensee shall ensure that a state-of-the-art backup of the Software, the complete system used and all data is in place and properly working. In addition to the foregoing, Licensee shall, at least daily and immediately before any maintenance or installation of Updates or Upgrades perform an alternating (on different data carriers) backup.</p>
<p>3.10 Licensee shall be responsible to install Updates and Upgrades.</p>
<p>3.11 Licensee shall promptly install all Updates and Upgrades and may object to installation of an Update or Upgrade only if Licensee agrees to compensate Licensor for the additional cost for continued support of the earlier version of the Software for the remaining term of the Agreement.</p>
<p>3.12 Licensee shall not (and shall not allow any third party to): (1) modify, create derivate works based on, decompile, reverse-compile, disassemble or reverse-engineer the Software, or any component of the Software, (2) attempt to reconstruct, identify or discover any source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms of the Software, or (3) attempt to circumvent any user limits, or other license, timing or use restrictions that are built into the Software.</p>
<p>3.13 Licensee agrees that its breach of this section or of Section 11 will cause Licensor irreparable harm and damage and that, as a result, Licensor shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to which Licensor might be entitled.</p>
<p>3.14 Licensee shall comply with all statutes and regulations, as they may be amended from time to time, pertaining to export control, money laundering, trade embargoes and economic sanctions.</p>

<h2>4. Term, Termination &amp; Effect of Termination<a class="headerlink" href="#term-termination-effect-of-termination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>4.1 This EULA shall run for the agreed term. Licensee can choose between a one-month-term model (“<strong>One-Month-Term Model</strong>”) and a one-year-term model (“<strong>One-Year-Term Model</strong>”). This EULA will renew after each term, unless terminated by a party pursuant to sec. 4.2 or 4.3 or 4.4, as the case may be. The term starts upon conclusion of this EULA and ends (i) in case of the One-Month-Term model, on the day before the day with the same number in the following month; if such day does not exist in the following month, on the last day of the following month, (ii) in case of the One-Year-Term model, on the day before the day with the same number of the same month in the following year; if such day does not exist in the following year, on the last day of the same month in the following year.</p>
<p>4.2 If the Parties agree upon the One-Month-Term Model, each Party shall be entitled to terminate this EULA at any point before the end of the respective term.</p>
<p>4.3 If the Parties agree upon the One-Year-Term Model, each Party shall be entitled to terminate this EULA with one month’s prior notice to the end of the respective term.</p>
<p>4.4 In case of Termination, Licensee will not be entitled to a refund.</p>
<p>4.5 Notices of termination shall be in writing to be effective. E-mail shall suffice.</p>
<p>4.6 Upon the end of this EULA, the Licensee shall return or delete the Software and all Software copies to Licensor and confirm to Licensor in writing Licensee’s compliance with this obligation.</p>
<p>4.7 The right of the Parties to terminate this EULA for good cause pursuant to sec. 314 of the German Civil Code (BGB) remains unaffected. For Licensor, good cause shall exist, in particular but not limited to, if
Licensee is in default with the license fee for thirty days or more than thirty days,
Licensee suspends its payments,
Licensee files for insolvency or similar statutory proceedings,
if permissible, Licensor or any other creditor applies for the institution of insolvency proceedings or similar statutory proceedings, if such a proceeding is opened or declined for a lack of assets, or
if Licensee significantly violates contractual agreements and fails to cease this breach within a reasonable grace period granted in a written warning issued by Licensor.</p>
