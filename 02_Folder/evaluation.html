  <p># How we evaluated that edaviz makes Data Scientists more than 10x faster</p>
<p>As you might know, edaviz started as a research project at the University of Karlsruhe. The goal was to increase the speed of Data Scientists during Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the tool in a meaningful way, we asked 20 Data Scientists from 8 companies:
## What are the most common tasks during data exploration?</p>
<p>Those are the 5 most common EDA tasks:
1. How many missing values does the data set contain? In which columns?
2. Univariate overview of a single column
3. Visualization of the joint distribution between 2 columns
4. Which column is a good predictor for a given target?
5. Between which columns exist predictive patterns?</p>
<p>So, the direction was clear but the big question was:
## Is it possible to solve those tasks for various data sets?</p>
<p>After months of development, we were very excited to test edaviz in a real business environment. The question was the following:
## How much faster is a professional Data Scientist with edaviz in comparison to his best default tool?</p>
<p>The evaluation was conducted together with 8 professional Data Scientists from the company STATWORX. And the approach was as follows:
- They were given 2 different data sets which they had never seen before
- They were asked to perform the 5 most common EDA tasks listed above
- For the first data set, they used their best default tool
- For the second data set, they used edaviz
- They had never seen edaviz before and received 15 minutes of training on a third data set
- We measured the duration to create the analysis for each task
- Of course, we permutated both the data sets and the order in which the tools were used</p>
<p>Here are the results:
## On average, the professional Data Scientists performed the 5 most common tasks more than 10x faster with edaviz after 15 minutes of training</p>
<p>All results are summarized in the following graph.</p>
<p>![alt text](<a class="reference external" href="https://edaviz-assets.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/edaviz_evaluation_durations.png">https://edaviz-assets.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/edaviz_evaluation_durations.png</a> “Results of the edaviz performance evaluation”)</p>
<p>On the x axis you can see each task. For each task, you can see the distribution of the task durations with and without edaviz. For the tasks 4 and 5, none of the Data Scientists completed the task within 5 minutes (300s) using their best default tool.</p>
<p>Let’s go through the first result in detail:
- The median Data Scientist needed 100s to create the analysis for the first task with his best default tool. With edaviz, he needed 2s.</p>
<p>And now, it is up to you.
## How fast can you solve the most common EDA tasks? Did you ever measure yourself?</p>
